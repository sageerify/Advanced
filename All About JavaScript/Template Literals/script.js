//Why we use template literals
//To make code easier and cleaner
const name = "John";
const age = 25;

const message = `Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;
console.log(message); // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 25 years old//

//Multi Lines
const multiLine = `This is line 1
This is line 2
This is line 3`;

console.log(multiLine);

//Examples

const a = 10;
const b = 20;

const result = `The sum of a and b is ${a + b}.`;
console.log(result); // Output: The sum of a and b is 30.
